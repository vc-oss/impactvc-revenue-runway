# Opportunity Source

## Purpose
Opportunity Source identifies **why a deal exists in the pipeline**.
It is independent of contact source, UTMs, lifecycle stage, or velocity timing.

This field exists to:
- ensure fair sales performance evaluation
- separate SDR, AE, partner, and marketing contribution
- prevent reps from being penalized for poor upstream qualification
- support account-based selling and re-engagement analysis
