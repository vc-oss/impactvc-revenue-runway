# Deal Velocity Model

## Purpose
Defines how Revenue Runway measures deal velocity in a way that is:
- fair to sales
- resilient to late data entry
- immune to stage backsliding
- compatible with SDR, AE, inbound, outbound, and partner motions

---

## Authoritative Dates

### Deal Created Date (System)
- Auto-generated by CRM
- Used only for audit purposes
- Never used for velocity calculations

---

### Deal Entered MQL Date (Marketing-Owned)
- Set when an opportunity first enters the MQL pipeline
- Only applicable if the deal ever enters MQL
- May remain blank for sales-created deals

Used to measure:
- inbound velocity
- SDR performance
- MQL → SQL handoff quality

---

### Deal Entered SQL Date (Sales-Owned)
**This is the authoritative velocity anchor for sales.**

Definition:
The date the opportunity entered the SQL pipeline as a sales-owned deal.

Rules:
- Set once
- Never overwritten
- Backdating allowed
- Required for all sales velocity reporting

Used to measure:
- rep cycle time
- fair close velocity
- sales performance

---

## Velocity Calculations

### Sales Velocity
- Deal Entered SQL Date → Close Won / Close Lost

### Marketing / SDR Velocity
- Deal Entered MQL Date → Deal Entered SQL Date

### Full Funnel Velocity
- Deal Entered MQL Date → Close

---

## Why This Model Exists
Sales reps:
- enter deals late
- move stages backwards
- skip stages entirely

Revenue Runway assumes imperfect human behavior and designs around it.
Velocity is anchored to intent, not system events.

---

## Reporting Principles
- Reps are never penalized for SDR qualification failures
- Close Lost outcomes must be interpreted with Opportunity Source
- Stage timestamps are diagnostic, not authoritative
