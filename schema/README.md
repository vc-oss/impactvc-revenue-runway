# Schemas

This folder contains CRM-agnostic schemas used by the Revenue Runway operating system.

Schemas define:
- Field mappings (contact, company, lifecycle)
- Inbound payload contracts
- Pipeline and lifecycle relationships
- Workflow expectations (logic, not tool-specific automation)

Nothing in this folder is tied to a specific CRM.
This allows Revenue Runway to be implemented in GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Salesforce, or future systems.
