# Perfect Prospect Meeting Playbook — Future Implementation Notes

This document defines how the **Perfect Prospect Meeting Playbook** is intended to be
captured, scored, and associated with an Opportunity in Revenue Runway.

The schema intentionally supports this capability **before** automation is implemented,
to avoid future refactoring.

---

## Purpose

Historical deal analysis showed materially higher close rates when opportunities
followed the **Perfect Prospect Meeting Playbook**.

This playbook is designed to:
- reinforce consistent sales behavior
- capture structured win intelligence
- support coaching and deal review
- remain lightweight for founder-led sales motions

---

## Related Opportunity Fields (Schema)

The following fields are already defined on the Opportunity object:

- `won_reasons` (Multi-select)
- `won_description` (Multi-line text)
- `ppm_playbook_score` (Number)
- `ppm_playbook_notes` (Multi-line text)

These fields are **not required** in v1 and may be enforced later via workflow.

## Implementation Options (Progressive)

### Option 1 — Manual Checklist + Score (Fastest)

**Description**
- Rep or founder completes a short checklist during or after deal review
- Checklist may be implemented via:
  - Google Form
  - GHL Survey
  - Manual review

**Data Handling**
- Score written to: `ppm_playbook_score`
- Summary or highlights written to: `ppm_playbook_notes`

**Notes**
- No automation required
- Suitable for founder-led or low-volume sales
- Enables immediate learning capture

### Option 2 — Close Won Gate (Light Automation)

**Trigger**
- Opportunity stage transitions to **Close Won**

**Enforcement Rules**
- `won_reasons` must not be empty
- `won_description` must not be empty
- `ppm_playbook_score` may be required (optional)

**Purpose**
- Standardize win reviews
- Improve consistency without heavy tooling
- Support rep accountability when a sales team exists

---

### Option 3 — Auto-Note Insertion (Nice-to-Have)

**Description**
- Upon checklist or survey submission:
  - A formatted note is automatically added to the Opportunity timeline

**Purpose**
- Preserve qualitative insight in the deal record
- Reduce manual copying
- Improve deal review context

**Notes**
- Optional enhancement
- Not required for core Revenue Runway functionality

---

## Design Principles

- Schema supports capability before automation exists
- Founder-led sales should not be burdened by process
- Automation is additive, not required
- Win intelligence is treated as a strategic asset
